### Adblock testers:

- **‚≠ê [CanYouBlockIt](https://canyoublockit.com/):** CanYouBlock it is one of the best websites to test your adblocker/s. This is my favourite website to test adblockers.

- **[ADBlockTester](https://adblock-tester.com/):** Also a very good website to test your adblocker.

- **[D3ward](https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock.html):** Similar to ADBlockTester.

### Adblockers for Android:

1. ‚≠ê [AdGuard](https://modyolo.com/download/adguard-28793/4)

::: danger Note:
- For Adguard to block ads better you need to edit some of the setting. To do this go to `Settings > Filtering > Filters` and enable all of the Ad filters, the first 6 privacy filters, all of the annoyance filters and if you want enable some language-specific filters. 
- Don't enable HTTPS filtering, it stops some sites from loading.
:::

2. ‚≠ê [AdAway](https://www.adaway.org): Open-source system-wide adblocker.

### Adblockers for your browser: 

:::warning Note:
Only install uBlock Origin which is shown in the guides below, adding more adblockers reduce effectiveness and trigger anti-adblock.
:::

::: danger Chrome is ruining adblockers 
Chrome and most other Chromium browsers are implementing Manifest V3, which disables uBlock Origin and other adblockers. You could use [uBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en&pli=1) however it's not as effective. Switch to Firefox or a Firefox based browser to contune using uBlock Origin.
:::

**1. ‚≠ê [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en&pli=1)**

**2. [Adguard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html)**
